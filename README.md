# Customer Churn Prediction App ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-based Customer Churn Prediction** system built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**. The app predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on their account and demographic details.  

It also provides **EDA visualizations** and allows **single or batch predictions** with downloadable CSV reports.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Churn distribution  
  - Churn by contract type  
  - Monthly charges distribution  
  - Correlation heatmap  

- **Churn Prediction:**  
  - Predict for **single customer** via input form  
  - Predict for **multiple customers** via CSV upload  
  - **Downloadable predictions** as CSV  

- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Random Forest Classifier (trained with scikit-learn)  
  - Scaled input features for better accuracy
